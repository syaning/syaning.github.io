## JavaScript

```js

  const rows = A.length
  const cols = A[0].length
  let max_overlap = 0

  for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
      const A_overlap = A.slice(i).map(r => r.slice(j))

          overlap += (A_overlap[x][y] & B_overlap[x][y])

        max_overlap = overlap
      }
